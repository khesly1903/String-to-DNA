# String-to-DNA

DNA Coding:

1. Principle: Uses four DNA bases (A, T, C, G) to encode data.

2. Encoding Scheme:
   00 -> A
   01 -> T
   10 -> C
   11 -> G

3. Process:
   a) Convert data to binary.
   b) Group binary into pairs.
   c) Map each pair to a DNA base.

4. Example:
   "Hi" -> 01001000 01101001 -> TACA TCCT

5. Applications:
   - Archival data storage
   - Bioinformatics
   - Potential for steganography

DNA coding offers a unique approach to data storage, mimicking biological systems for potential future applications in high-density, long-term data preservation.
